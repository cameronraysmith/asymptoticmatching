\section{\label{sec:results}Discussion}
The use of field-theoretic methods to analyze what are traditionally considered to be mass-action models has the benefit of unifying formalisms across scales. The mass-action model could be viewed as a kind of effective field theory which could in principle be unfolded into a more detailed model all the way down to the fundamental particles that underly the reactions being accounted for phenomenologically in the mass-action picture. On the other hand, whether the mass-action picture represents an accurate effective field theory is a matter for investigation as opposed to speculation and presenting it in this format lends to such endeavors even if they are currently considered to be impractical.
